# Assignment 1 Report

Purpose: 

Allows the user to do operations on an array that is generated from an input file.

Instructions:

(If using CLion, make sure it reloads the CMake Project and can read all the CMakeLists.txt files.)

Note: The input file (A1input.txt) is in the CS303-Assignments/cmake-build-debug/Assignment 1 folder, and is not in the CS303-Assignments/Assignment 1 folder

1.) Get the .cpp and .h files from the Assignment 1 folder; also get the A1input.txt file.

2.) Run the code (from the .cpp file) in a C++ compiler

3.) Input values to run the program (It will usually request integers within certain restraints, like an integer between 1 to 6, etc.)

4.) Enjoy
