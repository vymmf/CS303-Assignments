# CS303- Assignments Navigation

There should be a folder for each assignment, containing a header file, implementation C++ file, and a README.md file (as a report).

Since I use CLion as my IDE for these assignments, there will be a CMakeLIsts.txt file, which is used to run and debug configurations (basically multiple files under a specific folder/group) at a time.

Additionally, there may be input or other types of files that are used for each assignment.
